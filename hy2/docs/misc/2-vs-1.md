# Hysteria 2 vs Hysteria 1

Hysteria 2 inherited almost all features of Hysteria 1.x while introducing a variety of new fixes and enhancements. It's important to note, however, that the protocol and codebase have undergone significant changes and as a result, **Hysteria 2 is NOT compatible with Hysteria 1.x.** Users must choose either 1.x or 2.x for both the client and server.

### Key improvements

Some of the most notable include:

- **New Protocol**: The redesigned protocol can masquerade as HTTP/3 to increase censorship resistance.
- **0-RTT UDP Session Establishment**: No delay for the first packet of a UDP session.
- **New ACL and Outbound System**: Use different outbounds for different requests.
- **Traffic Stats API**: For easier monitoring and management.
- **Performance Improvements**: Various enhancements under the hood to improve performance and stability.

### Missing features

There are some features present in Hysteria 1.x that have not yet been implemented in Hysteria 2:

- **Client-Side ACL**: ACL is only available on the server side for now.
- **FakeTCP Protocol**: FakeTCP has always been a somewhat niche feature and we are still evaluating whether to bring it back.
